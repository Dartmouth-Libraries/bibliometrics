Co-pyrolysis is a promising alternative for transforming this material into solid and liquid products with high added value. This study evaluated how heating rates and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) proportions influence the properties of char obtained by co-pyrolysis. The co-pyrolysis process was carried out using Eucalyptus spp biomass, in three proportions of PET (0, 15 and 25 %) and three heating rates (1, 3 and 5 °C min−1), at a final temperature of 450 °C. We investigated the physical, chemical, energetic and thermal properties of the char produced, which included its morphology via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The average yield of co-pyrolytic char, under all conditions of co-pyrolysis, decreased by 5 % compared to the biomass-only pyrolytic material. In addition to yield differences, the percentage of ash decreased by about 7 % in char with PET. The produced material had a maximum heating value of 32,17 MJ kg−1 and maximum energy density of 4.7 Gcal m−3 (1.10 GJ m−3). These results show the synergistic effect between PET and biomass, pointing to improvements in char generated through co-pyrolysis. The addition of PET in the process, in all conditions investigated, contributed to potentiating the energy characteristics of the material. This co-pyrolysis process can be an alternative for generation and biofuels.

In this study, we investigated the antiviral potential of bio-oil (BO) obtained from residual woody biomass of Citrus sinensis. BOs were produced through pyrolysis at different heating rates (1, 3, 5, and 7 °C min−1) and subsequently underwent a purification process. Physical-chemical analyses and identification of chemical compounds were performed using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). Furthermore, the hemolytic capacity of BOs and their activity against the 3 C L protease enzyme (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated. The heating rate was found to affect the chemical properties of the BOs, resulting in variations in pH and chemical composition. A total of 23 chemical compounds were identified, with a significant presence of furans, pyrans, and phenolic compounds. Regarding hemolytic capacity, concentrations equal to or below 1% of BOs showed no hemolytic effect. Concerning antiviral activity, the BO obtained at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 demonstrated greater efficacy in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 compared to the BO obtained at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. This antiviral activity may be associated with the synergistic action of the chemical compounds present in the bio-oils, especially phenolic compounds.

At 40 bar of hydrogen pressure, 80 °C of temperature, with a flow of 0.1 mLmin-1, 99% conversion with selectivity of 98% towards the hydrogenated product was obtained. The catalytic ability of Ru-HC was investigated across a variety of substrate scopes.

The MIL-53(Al)@HC hybrid showed in situ MIL-53(Al) crystal growth capability. Batch adsorption experiments were carried out to study the effect of pH, adsorbent dosage, adsorbate concentration, contact time and temperature effect. The results obtained under extreme conditions demonstrate that MIL-53(Al)@HC is an adsorbent capable of removing >98% of IBU and MTM in mixture at a concentration of 0.3 mM (68 ppm IBU and 115 ppm MTM). The pseudo-second order model adequately described the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium using the Sips and Freundlich models. The physico-statistical microscopic model (2-layer) corroborated the hypothesis of a multilayer adsorption proposed by the macroscopic Freundlich model. In the competition study between IBU and MTM, both antagonistic and synergistic effects were observed.

Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is one of the most versatile technologies for converting renewable biomass feedstocks (especially in the wet state) into biofuel (biocrude oil) in a compact plant. Therefore, this review is devoted to thoroughly reviewing and critically discussing biocrude oil production from biomass feedstocks through the HTL process. This review starts by discussing the principles of biomass HTL processing and product upgrading, aiming to provide a grounded and broad understanding of current developments in this domain. The data reported in the published literature are analyzed and visualized in order to scrutinize the effects of the main process parameters on the quantity, quality, cost, and environmental impacts of resultant biofuels. Higher biocrude oil yields are obtained at temperatures, pressures, and residual times between 300 and 350 °C, 24–27 MPa, and 15–25 min, respectively. Concerning yield and calorific value, biocrude oil derived from homogeneous catalysts demonstrates figures of 23.6 % and 32.1 MJ/kg, whereas that from heterogeneous catalysts exhibits percentages of 66.8 % and 40 MJ/kg, respectively. The challenges and prospects for the future development of biocrude oil are also discussed. HTL has a long way to go before being used for biofuel production on a large scale.

In this work, the interactions of fatty acids with silica are investigated using a wide range of experimental and computational techniques (TPD MS, DFT, FTIR, in situ IR, equilibrium adsorption, and thermogravimetry). The adsorption isotherms of linear and branched fatty acids C1-C6 on the silica surface from aqueous solution have been obtained. The relative quantities of different types of surface complexes, as well as kinetic parameters of their decomposition, were calculated. The formation of surface complexes with a coordination bond between the carbonyl oxygens and silicon atoms in the surface-active center, which becomes pentacoordinate, was confirmed by DFT calculations, in good agreement with the IR feature at ∼1680 cm 1.

In the continuous EC test, synthetic water containing kaolin with an initial turbidity of 150 NTU was treated at a flow rate of 300 mL.min−1 and a voltage of 30 V for 30 min. This configuration achieved a turbidity removal efficiency of 97.26%. However, the treated water exhibited an increase in aluminum concentration from 5.881 mg.L−1 to 6.871 mg.L−1, exceeding the limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO). This unfavorable consequence was attributed to the release of aluminum metal ions during the inherent electrolytic oxidation process in EC. Furthermore, an economic analysis showed that the operating costs for continuous operation amounted to 0.087 USD.m−3, demonstrating the economic viability of implementing the continuous EC reactor on a larger scale.', authkeywords='Kaolin | Low cost treatment | Sludge characterization | Turbidity | Water treatment', citedby_count=3, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='RUDN University'),\n",

Various analytical methods, including TEM, XRD, XPS and N2 adsorption-desorption, were used to characterize both IBOMC and the synthesized catalyst (Ru@IBOMC). Ru@IBOMC was then successfully utilized in the continuous flow catalytic hydrogenation of LA to γ-valerolactone and N-containing heterocycles at room temperature. The effects of different reaction variables (such as temperature, H2 gas pressure, solvent, LA concentration, and flow rate) were examined. This catalytic protocol exclusively affords quantitative yields of γ-valerolactone at room temperature under continuous flow conditions under 30 bar H2 pressure. The catalyst also exhibits excellent activity for producing N-containing heterocycles at room temperature by using either aniline or acetonitrile as the amine source. The catalyst shows consistent performance for at least 72 hours without significant loss of activity and selectivity in a wide range of solvents, giving an excellent weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 48 h−1.

An attractive route is the transfer hydrogenation of furfural using acidic-basic catalysts. In this work, mixed oxides derived from ternary hydrotalcites were employed to obtain furfuryl alcohol from furfural assisted by microwave irradiation. These materials were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and the CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) analyses. The lamellar structure of hydrotalcite-type materials collapses during the calcination process, resulting in the loss of carbonate anions and hydroxyl groups, present in the interlayer space. This leads to the formation of mixed oxides that exhibit larger surface areas. Furthermore, these changes alter the basic nature of these materials, giving rise to the formation of strong basic sites. The reaction was studied using containing Co2+ and Ni2+ in their structure and was then optimized using distinct primary and secondary alcohols as hydrogen donor sources, as well as distinct temperatures and initial concentrations of furfural. The yields to furfuryl alcohol are strongly dependent on the type of Me2+ in layered oxides mainly due to higher basicity and to the donor employed in the reaction. The mixed oxide containing Co2+ showed complete conversion of furfural and higher yields to furfuryl alcohol (>95 %) at short times of reaction (<1 h).', authkeywords='biomass | furfural | microwave synthesis | mixed oxides | transfer hydrogenation', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='CONICET', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas'),\n",

This paper aims to present the recent advances in biofuel production from microalgae and the potential benefits of microalgae in the energy and environmental sectors, as well as sustainable development. Besides, bottlenecks and challenges mainly relating to techniques of cultivation and harvesting, as well as downstream processes are completely presented. Promising solutions and novel trends for realizing strategies of producing biofuels from microalgae on an industrial and commercial scale are also discussed in detail. Alternatively, the role of microalgae in the circular economy is thoroughly analyzed, indicating that the potential of scaling up current microalgae-based production could benefit from the waste-to-energy strategy with microalgae as a key intermediate.

The main objective of the present study was to investigate the potential of the hybrid material MIL-53(Al)@RH for the adsorption of glyphosate in aqueous solution. The material was obtained following the methodology of MIL-53(Al) synthesis in the presence of hydrolyzed rice husk assisted by microwave. Batch adsorption experiments were carried out to evaluate the adsorbent dosage, pH0 solution effect, contact time, adsorbate concentration, and temperature effect. The results demonstrated that a maximum adsorption capacity of 296.95 mg g−1, at pH0 4 with a ratio of 0.04 g MIL-53(Al)@RH/50 mL of solution, was achieved in 30 min.

The enthalpy changes (ΔH°) determined propose an endothermic reaction governed by chemisorption, corroborating the kinetic and equilibrium settings. Hydrogen bonds, π*-π interactions, and complexation between the metal centers of MIL-53(Al) and the anionic groups of glyphosate were postulated to be involved as adsorption mechanisms.

Deep understanding of the thermodynamic aspects involved in this process is key for a successful outcome, but detailed studies are missing in the existing literature. A thermodynamic study of the reaction of γ-valerolactone (GVL) production from bio-derived methyl levulinate (ML) is performed by the Gibbs free energy minimization method. The effect of various reaction conditions (temperature, concentration, flow rate) and the implication of possible intermediates and byproducts are assessed.

Significant increases in GVL selectivity can be achieved under dry conditions, keeping the high conversion.

Subsequently, focusing on the functional group modification strategy for the conversion of LBADs, we raise a “Demand Orientation” concept and several typical API synthesis routes. This tutorial review provides green production routes from LBADs in six instances (i.e., trimebutine, aniracetam, diethylstilbestrol, dopamine, acetaminophen, oxybuprocaine). Finally, several others APIs from LBADs via theoretically feasible and sustainable routes are proposed. Some personal perspectives are provided to highlight the opportunities within this attractive field.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=6, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSFC', fund_no='21KJA150003', fund_sponsor='National Natural Science Foundation of China'),\n",

In recent years, PFASs have caused global concern due to their presence in different water and soil matrices, which threatens the environment and human health. These compounds have been reported to be linked to the development of serious human diseases, including but not limited to cancer. For this reason, PFASs have been considered as persistent organic compounds (COPs) and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Therefore, this work aims to present the advances in remediation of PFASs-contaminated soil and water by addressing the current literature. The performance and characteristics of each technique were addressed deeply in this work. The reviewed literature found that PFASs elimination studies in soil and water were carried out at a laboratory and pilot-scale in some cases. It was found that ball milling, chemical oxidation and thermal desorption are the most efficient techniques for the removal of PFASs in soils, however, phyto-microbial remediation is under study, which claims to be a promising technique. For the remediation of PFASs-contaminated water, the processes of electrocoagulation, membrane filtration, ozofractionation, catalysis, oxidation reactions - reduction, thermolysis and destructive treatments with plasma have presented the best results. It is noteworthy that hybrid treatments have also proved to be efficient techniques in the removal of these contaminants from soil and water matrices. Therefore, the improvisation and implication of existing techniques on a field-scale are greatly warranted to corroborate the yields obtained on a pilot- and laboratory-scale.', authkeywords='Human exposure | PFASs | Remediation techniques | Short chain | Soil | Water', citedby_count=3, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='PYT235-CONV2019-FCMFQ0018', fund_sponsor=None),\n",

Zeolites are materials that can be synthesized or found in natural rock deposits a with a basic composition consisting in Al, Si, and O. Zeolite’s consideration as a future material is due to many facile synthesis methods to obtain different structures with variations in pore size, surface area, pore volume and physical properties. These methods are developed using the control of relevant synthesis parameters that influences structure formation, such as crystallization temperature, time of aging and/or crystallization, stoichiometric relationships between components of synthesis gel, pH of the medium, and in some cases the type of structure-directing agent. Each method will lead to geometric changes in the framework formation, making possible the formation of typical chemical bonds that are the fingerprint of any zeolitic structure (O-Si-O and Al-O-Si), forming typical acid sites that give specificity in zeolite and allows it to act as a nanoreactor. The specificity is a characteristic that in some cases depends on selectivity, a fundamental property derived of the porosity, mostly in processes that occur inside the zeolite. In processes outside the structure, the surface area is the main factor influencing this property. Moreover, there are many natural sources with adequate chemical composition to be used as precursors. Some of these sources are waste, minimizing the deposition of potential hazardous materials that can be recalcitrant pollutants depending on the environment. Besides its uses as a catalyst, zeolite serves as a support for many bioprocesses; therefore, this review aims to explain relevant aspects in chemical nature, physical properties, main methods of synthesis, main precursors used for synthesis, and relevant applications of zeolites in chemical catalysis and biological processes.', authkeywords='biological applications | catalysis | synthesis | zeolite', citedby_count=10, openaccess=1, freetoread='repositoryvor', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr='CAPES', fund_no='315279/2021-4', fund_sponsor='Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior'),\n",

Here in, we successfully synthesized a vigorous photocatalysts comprising of g-C3N4 and doped ZnO–W/M (M = Co, Ce, Yb, Sm) by co-precipitation followed by metals doping via calcination approach. The structural, morphological, and photocatalytic applications for organic pollutants of synthesized heterostructure nanocomposites were examined by XRD, FTIR, SEM, EDX and UV visible spectrophotometer. Diffraction peaks attributed to both g-C3N4 and ZnO–W were detected in the XRD spectra. The FTIR spectra also inveterate the formation of g-C3N4/ZnO–W/M composites. The SEM images reveal an agglomerated morphology and EDS analysis also confirmed close contact between g-C3N4, ZnO–W and doped metals. The abridged energy band gap of g-C3N4/ZnO–W/M (M = Ce, Yb, Sm, Co) nanocomposites calculated via Tauc plot are 2.68, 2.88, 3.24 and 3.29 eV respectively. Narrowing of bandgap is considered an imperative triumph for the degradation of industrial effluents. The photocatalytic activity was performed against four different dyes and follows the trend Ce > Yb > Sm > Co. The recyclability tests were carried out for different dyes and no substantial catalytic activity loss was observed even after the fourth experimental run, which proves that reported ternary heterojunctions exhibit high mechanical stability and reusability.The species trapping experiment exposed that generated h+ are the principal active specie for dye photodegradation reactions.

Prepared nanocomposite electrolyte material is considered as a novel material owing to the results obtained in terms of improved ionic conductivity, power density, and current density at lower operational temperature. The material has been analyzed as well crystalline material with a dual-phase as confirmed by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The structural morphology of designed electrolyte materials was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), including high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) showed a remarkably lower charge transfer resistance than conventional electrolyte materials. Obtained results illustrated that ionic conductivity increased, which lead to the acceleration of the electrode reactions. Heterostructure nanocomposite SZMMY-ZnO is beneficial to attain a high ionic conductivity due to the suppression of electronic conduction through the p-n junction. The maximum power density was noted as 841 mW cm−2 at 550 °C with a maximum current density of 2287 mA cm−2. Based on optical properties through the p-n junction, the internal electronic current was blocked, which further reduced the short circuit problem in the heterostructure. In addition, the performance and lifetime test indicated good stability of the cell at 550 °C with a very small degradation loss.

Thermal hydrogenation is probably the most mature method to achieve this goal. However, this reaction should not be considered only as the reduction of CO2, but must be conceptualised as the conversion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen to value-added compounds and water. In that case, the source of hydrogen cannot be ignored. Due to the high stability of the carbon dioxide molecule, its reduction by thermal hydrogenation requires a catalyst.

The use of coffee as a template pursues the preparation of a nanostructured heterojunction without the need for a solvent. Two variables were optimized in the synthesis process, i.e. calcination temperature and proportion of CeOx. Firstly, bare coffee-template titania was prepared to explore the effect of the calcination temperature, within 500–650 °C. The anatase phase was obtained up to 600 °C. Higher temperatures, i.e. 650 °C, led to the appearance of rutile (10%) and efficient removal of the sacrificial agent (0.6% residue). The maximum photocatalytic activity in terms of conversion, in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, was achieved employing the bare coffee-template TiO2 at 650 °C, and it was found comparable to the benchmarked P25. The incorporation of ceria in the solvent-free approach considerably improved photocatalytic benzaldehyde production. No changes in the XRD pattern of TiO2 were appreciated in the presence of ceria due to the low amount added, within 1.5–6.0%, confirmed by XPS as superficial Ce3+/Ce4+. The UV–visible absorption spectra were considerably redshifted in the presence of Ce, reducing the bandgap values of bare titania. An optimum amount of ceria in the structure within 3-0% was found.

After a brief presentation of the use of the main series of MOFs as efficient adsorbents for different types of pollutants, the limitations of these structures related to particle size and hydrodynamic problems during their application are highlighted. Lignocellulosic biomasses are also recognized as an alternative adsorbent, mainly due to their high natural abundance and their low environmental impact during and after their application. The limited capacity of bioadsorbents becomes important in this research. Consequently, the largest amount of information existing in the last ten years on MOF-Biomass functionalization as a hybrid and improvement technology for adsorption processes is compiled, analyzed, compared and contrasted. So far, there is no evidence of works that exploit the concept of functionalization of adsorbents of different nature to give rise to new hybrid materials. Through this review it was found that the hybrids obtained show a higher adsorption capacity (Qe) compared to their precursors, due to the increase of organic functional groups provided by the biomass. Thus, for heavy metals, dyes, Arsenium anions and other organic and pharmaceutical compounds, there are increases in Qe of about 100 mg g−1. The possibility of the new hybrid being studied for desorption and reuse processes is also raised, resulting in a new line of research that is attractive for the industry from an economic and environmental point of view. The functionalization methods and techniques used in the studies cited in this article are outlined.

Herein, several H2O-organic solvent systems were selected for solvolysis of the lignin in wood chips to obtain the lignin oligomers with different structural features. Afterwards, the reaction liquors containing soluble lignin oligomers were employed to produce LNPs via continuous adding H2O. The self-assembly behaviors of the lignin oligomers were strongly influenced by the structural features of the lignin oligomers and the existing organic solvents. From solvothermal extraction in H2O-polar aprotic solvents (e.g. tetrahydrofuran, acetone, and γ-valerolactone), the lignin oligomers with widely-ranged molecular weight could self-assemble into regular-shaped and spherical LNPs, making use of every single space. Besides, the conjugated aliphatic side chains with benzene rings and the abundant negative charged groups of the lignin oligomers favored their self-assembly into LNPs with core-shell structures, and the resultant high electric surface charge prevented further aggregation of LNPs into irregular-shaped clusters. Conversely, the existing polar protic solvents (e.g. ethanol and ethylene glycol) and polysaccharides-derived chemicals, dispersed the lignin oligomers and restrained their π-π stacking induced self-assembly via generating undesirable hydrogen bonds. Therefore, ascertaining the ripple effects of the organic solvents on the whole fabrication process of LNPs benefits to control the morphology of LNPs for various applications.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=11, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSFC', fund_no='22078211', fund_sponsor='National Natural Science Foundation of China'),\n",

In this regard, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have been indentified due to their interesting properties, such as good mechanical strength, high electrical conductivity, and desirable morphological features. Broadly speaking, CNFs can be categorized as vapor-grown carbon nanofibers (VGCNFs) and carbonized CNFs (e.g., electrospun CNFs), which have distinct microstructure, morphologies, and physicochemical properties. In addition to their physicochemical properties, VGCNFs and electrospun CNFs have distinct performances in biomedicine and have their own pros and cons. Indeed, several review papers in the literature have summarized and discussed the different types of CNFs and their performances in the industrial, energy, and composites areas.

Desiccant air-conditioning (DAC) is an effective method to reduce humidity and energy simultaneously. Conventional desiccants are not suitable for use as a desiccant in building air conditioners, mainly because of high regeneration temperature and other issues such as limited equilibrium capacity and hydrothermal and cyclic instability. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a novel class of porous crystalline materials without the disadvantages of traditional desiccants. They benefit from a huge surface area and considerable pore-volume, very low framework density, and a high-water uptake capacity. In this review article, we have critically and comprehensively discussed the use of MOFs in heat transformation and air conditioning processes. The reasons for the superiority of MOFs over traditional desiccant materials are also discussed comprehensively. Moreover, since thermal conductivity is a key factor in the heat transfer process, an overview has been made on techniques of measuring the thermal conductivity of MOFs. Eventually, several state-of-the-art MOF-based heat transformation applications are reviewed, including heat storage, heat pumps and different desiccant dehumidifiers.', authkeywords='Desiccant dehumidifiers | Heat exchanger | Heat pumps | Heat transformation | Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)', citedby_count=48, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None),\n",

All the nanoparticles were found having particle size 20–80 nm and crystallite 3–20 nm. Photocatalytic activity of synthesized nanoparticles has been evaluated by carrying out degradation of two dyes methyl orange (MO) and Congo red (CR) in the presence of nanocatalysts. Degradation of both the dyes was carried out separately using Fe, Mn and Fe-Mn nanoparticles to compare the efficiency of monometallic with bimetallic nanoparticles. Iron and manganese monometallic particles have completely degraded MO in 18 min and 20 min and CR in 24 min and 18 min respectively.

In this paper, a biorefinery strategy is proposed at a laboratory scale in order to overcome the issue of the OPW seasonality. OPW was preliminary subjected to a long-term ensiling (up to 12 weeks) with the twofold purpose of preserving the OPW potential for methane production through anaerobic digestion (AD) and stimulating the production of value-added compounds by means of biological (leachate of a previous ensiling process) and chemical (MnCl2) supplements and/or their combination. On the liquid fraction of the ensiled OPW, lactic acid (LA), acetic acid (AA), and ethanol concentrations were detected. Instead, solid fractions were used as substrates for AD both in batch and semi-continuous modes. Specifically, the combined stimulation led to LA and AA yields of 54.5 and 16.6 g kgTS-1, respectively, after 8 weeks, whereas the largest yield of ethanol (i.e., 70.4 g kgTS-1) was achieved after 8 weeks of ensiling without any stimulation. Chemical and combined stimulation allowed us to preserve in the solid fraction, separated by centrifugation after long-term (8-12 weeks) ensiling, about 50% of the methane potential of the fresh OPW. Moreover, semi-continuous AD resulted in semi-stable processes for all the solid fractions (methane yields ranging from 0.23 to 0.28 NL gVSloaded-1) even though nutrients supplementation was necessary.', authkeywords='anaerobic digestion | biorefinery | ensiling | lactic acid | methane | orange peel waste', citedby_count=3, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='UNIRC', fund_no='1062/2021', fund_sponsor='Università degli Studi Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria'),\n",

Accordingly, the variations of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yields and cellulose solubilities of [Bmim][HSO4], [Bmim][H2PO4], and [Bmim]2[HPO4] under different water conditions are experimentally and theoretically studied. Results indicate that [Bmim][HSO4], [Bmim][H2PO4], and [Bmim]2[HPO4] are acid, weak alkaline, and strong alkaline catalysts of transesterification of lipid with methanol, respectively. FAME yields of both [Bmim][HSO4]- and [Bmim][H2PO4]-catalyzed reactions increase initially with the addition of 1.5 g of water, while they decrease with the increase of water content because of the consequent decline of the nucleophilic index and electrophilic index of the OH groups of [Bmim][HSO4] and [Bmim][H2PO4], respectively. Analogously, slight decreases of FAME yields of [Bmim]2[HPO4]-catalyzed transesterification are observed within 0.0-3.0 g of water, while a notable decrease is presented when 6.0 g of water is added. Contrary to the variation of catalytic properties, the cellulose solubilities of [Bmim][HSO4], [Bmim][H2PO4], and [Bmim]2[HPO4] all decrease with the addition of 1.5 g of water, as the water molecules occupy the H-bonding sites of [Bmim][HSO4]-cellobiose (clb), while the H-bonding interactions of water-clb and water-[Bmim][H2PO4] formed by shared oxygen atoms are enhanced with the increase of water content, subsequently enhancing the H-bonding interactions of ILs-clb and relative cellulose solubilities. The variations of cellulose solubilities of ILs with the addition of 0.0-6.0 g of water are opposite to those of their catalytic properties. This study indicates that the cellulose solubilities and catalytic properties of [Bmim][HSO4], [Bmim][H2PO4], and [Bmim]2[HPO4] compete with each other under different water conditions, providing a potential strategy to offset the negative effect of water content on IST of wet algae.', authkeywords='dual roles | in situ transesterification | ionic liquids | microalgae', citedby_count=6, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='KJ2021A0031', fund_sponsor='Anhui University'),\n",

We will also talk about the applications of nanocomposite in water splitting, dye degradation, solar fuel generations, and organic transformations.

The photocatalytic system’s remarkable stability has been described in terms of facile recyclability. The adsorption ability of phenolic compounds has been addressed in the form of Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm with various factors (pH, concentration, the intensity of light, the effect of catalyst, the effect of time, etc.). The purpose of this review is to survey mechanisms and processes that enlist graphene-based composite in terms of efficacy and dose of catalyst required to attain 99% degradation. Nanoparticles may cause toxicity and a pretext for their toxicity has been mentioned.

Hydrothermal gasification (HTG) has shown great potential as an effective method for valorizing wet biomass. The high-quality syngas produced using the HTG process can be chemically/biochemically converted to liquid biofuels. Therefore, this paper aims to comprehensively review and critically discuss syngas production from biomass using the HTG process and its conversion into liquid biofuels. The basics and mechanisms of biomass HTG processing are first detailed to provide a comprehensive and deep understanding of the process. Second, the effects of the main operating parameters on the performance of the HTG process are numerically analyzed and mechanistically discussed. The syngas cleaning/conditioning and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis are then detailed, aiming to produce liquid biofuels. The economic performance and environmental impacts of liquid biofuels using the HTG-FT route are evaluated. Finally, the challenges and prospects for future development in this field are presented. Overall, the maximum total gas yield in the HTG process is obtained at temperature, pressure, and residence time in the range of 450–500 °C, 28–30 MPa, and 30–60 min, respectively. The highest C5+ liquid hydrocarbon selectivity in the FT process is achieved at temperatures between 200 and 240 °C. Generally, effective conversion of biomass to syngas using the HTG process and its successful upgrading using the FT process can offer a viable route for producing liquid biofuels. Future studies should use HTG technology in the biorefinery context to maximize biomass valorization and minimize waste generation.', authkeywords='Catalyst | Fischer-tropsch synthesis | Hydrothermal gasification | Liquid biofuels | Supercritical water | Syngas', citedby_count=41, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr='MOHE', fund_no='63933', fund_sponsor='Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia'),\n",

Since crop residues are by-products of agricultural production, crop residue collection does not compete with food crops for acreage and therefore, it does not negatively impact food prices. Moreover, it has the advantage of reducing the amount of waste, the disposal of which often becomes a serious problem despite natural sources. Biomass conversion becomes a very valid alternative to diversify energy sources and reduce global warming. Thermochemical treatment of biomass is a promising way to convert biomass into bio-oil, biochar, and gas. In recent years, interest in the conversion of plant biomass into biochar has increased because this carbonaceous material has interesting properties that guarantee applications in wastewater treatment, soil improvement, solid fuels, and energy. The processes performed to convert biomass into biochar are different and the most used are thermochemical processes: pyrolysis, torrefaction, hydrothermal treatment, and gasification. The studies of the thermokinetic parameters that control these processes are carried out using different methods that provide the necessary information for the applicability of the processes on an industrial scale. One of the objectives of the present review is to compare kinetic models in order to clarify the role of the conversion process and the effects of the process parameters on the final product. A comprehensive investigation of the thermokinetic parameters controlling the conversion of crop residues to biochar was conducted. The mathematical description of kinetic processes is usually performed using the Arrhenius equation and its derivatives to obtain the activation energies (Ea), the pre-exponential parameter, and the process mechanisms. While isothermal processes can be described using the model fitting method, isoconversional processes can be studied using both the model fitting method and model-free methods. The high complexity and diversity of the reactions involved could lead to the use of approximations. In this paper, an overview of the kinetic parameters determined for biochar production processes and the model used to determine them is given.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=11, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='1381266-R', fund_sponsor='Universidad de Córdoba'),\n",

The sluggish kinetics of these reaction is a challenging situation on the surface of electrodes which imposes large over-potential and affects the energy output of fuel cells. Although the platinum-based electrode materials have excellent activity toward ORR/OER but their high cost limits commercialization of fuel cells. To deal with this problem, platinum-free electrode materials has aroused the considerations of scientists. The present work is proposed to study the oxygen reduction reaction and water oxidation on the surface of xAg2O-yPrO2/γ-Al2O3/Glassy-Carbon. The ORR was studied electrochemically via cyclic voltammetry on the surface of these nano-catalysts while the OER was investigated via cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry in alkaline media. The mechanism of ORR on catalysts surface was enquired and the results indicate that ORR followed two electrons pathway in case of 10PrO2/γ-Al2O3/Glassy-Carbon while four electrons reduction pathway is identified on surface of others catalysts which divulged that addition of silver with praseodymium shifted the mechanism from 2e− to 4e− pathway. The electrocatalysts featured the stability during multiple scans and no corrosion of electrode in OER/ORR is observed. Different kinetic parameters for both reactions are determined which affirmed that both ORR and OER on the active surface of catalysts is irreversible and diffusion controlled. 4Ag2O-6PrO2/γ-Al2O3 is indicated to be proficient electro-catalyst among other members of the series, having greater value of mass transport and diffusion coefficients. The bi-functionality of all electrocatalysts are verified by their electrochemical responses in alkaline medium.

MSW utilization for recycling is important for transforming the linear economy model into a circular one. The current review analyses and categorises MSW to energy technologies into direct and indirect approaches taking the Circular Economy perspective. The direct approach involves incinerating MSW for heat recovery. The indirect approach, including thermochemical and biochemical processes, is more complicated but attractive due to the variety of the valorized products – such as syngas, bio-oil, biochar, digestate, humus. However, consensus on the best MSW treatment approach is yet to be established due to the inconsistency of assessment criteria in the existing studies. In the case of converting MSW to energy (Waste-to-Energy – W2E), its economic indicators, such as capital, compliance, and operation cost, are important criteria when implementations are considered. In the current work, the critical characteristics of technologies for the MSW to energy routes are scrutinised. In addition, the economic characteristics and the role of MSW in the circular bio-economy is also thoroughly evaluated. Methods to advocate the industrial adoption and important assessing aspects of W2E are proposed at the end of the review to address the environmental and resource management issues related to MSW – most notably dealing with the uncertainty in composition and amounts, the energy efficiency and the resource demands of the W2E processing.', authkeywords='Circular economy | Energy production | Environment management | Municipal solid waste | Waste management', citedby_count=121, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='MOST', fund_no='CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000456', fund_sponsor='Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan'),\n",

GVL yield reached 74% with 79% EL conversion at 190 °C for 5 h over 10 wt% Zr–TiO2 in 2-PrOH. The high catalytic activity could be attributed to an appropriate proportion of acidic/basic sites, high Brønted/Lewis acid ratio, and large surface areas. Both acidic and basic sites lead to a synergistic effect on the concurrent activation of H-donor and substrate. The major side product ethyl 4-hydroxypentanoate (EHP) and other byproducts were found. GVL yield achieved from methyl levulinate (ML) and levulinic acid (LA) were 65% and 20%, respectively. Catalyst deactivation was observed due to coke deposits on the catalyst's surface.

In citing this statement, herein, we reported bio-synthesis of copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles by Leucophyllum frutescens leaf extract-mediated reaction along with the study of morphological, optical, structural features and their photocatalytic dye degradation activity of synthesized nanoparticles. The formation of bio-mediated CuO nanoparticles was confirmed by the XRD having crystalline size of 27 nm and monoclinic structure, FTIR presenting absorption band at 673 cm−1. The phase purity was revealed from XRD as there is no extra peak for impurities. The CuO represents the absorption of UV radiations at 380 nm upon UV-DRS studies and band gap energy of 1.48 eV. The morphological studies wereperformed by the FESEM and TEM, both characterized that CuO nanoparticles are spherical in shape. The particle size calculated by particle distribution through FESEM and SEM micrographs was ∼ 25 nm which is in accordance with the crystalline size calculated by XRD. The formation of CuO nanoparticles and phase purity was further validated by the EDX analysis. The metallic existence, phase purity and valency of synthesized nanoparticles confirmed by the XPS. The photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue was studied by CuO under irradiation of visible light. The synthesized CuO degraded the cationic dye in 120 min with the degradation efficiency of 88%. Thus, the proposed work suggests the synthesis of metal oxides nanoparticles via green synthesis is very cost effective and ecofriendly process.

The presence of waste nut residues in nature may lead to the environmental problems. The use of this waste for various applications is a very important issue. Nuts contain precious chemicals, which may be advantageous for preparing (nano)materials for the catalytic purposes. Different parts of nuts such as shell, kernel, extracts, etc. have valuable components, which can be used directly to make a variety of heterogeneous catalysts or as stabilising and reducing agents for nanoparticles. For example, the shell of some nuts is rich in lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose, which can be used as an effective and environmentally friendly supports for the heterogeneous catalysts. The design and application of safer and cheaper catalytic systems for different applications including organic synthesis, hydrogen evolution reactions, oxidation reactions, hydrolysis, degradation of pollutants, etc., are an extreme necessity in which nuts and their wastes can play a significant part due to their excellent chemical properties. Cheaper catalysts comprise of natural compounds such as biopolymers, aluminosilicates, kernel shells, zeolites, diatomites, agricultural wastes (such as bagasse pith, rice husk, smaise cob, coconut shell), nut wastes, etc. These compounds are of natural origin and therefore do not harm the environment. Since they are considered a type of waste, they are also cheap and economical. This review for the first time summarises the preparation of (nano)materials from nuts as an environmentally benign resources and their catalytic applications and highlights the industrial benefits and potential applications of these economically sustainable green resources to convert waste to wealth. The recent developments in the synthesis and applications of bio(nano)catalysts in catalytic and environmental areas have been discussed. In this review, the application of nuts as an efficient supports and green reducing agents for the synthesis of nanomaterials has been discussed. Due to the beneficial compounds, which they contain, activated carbon can be extracted from them and used to make heterogeneous catalysts. These bio(nano)catalysts are applied for organic synthesis, hydrogen evaluation reaction (HER), oxidation reactions and hydrolysis for an environmental applications in reduction and degradation of nitro compounds and organic dyes.', authkeywords='Bio(nano)materials | Catalysis | Degradation of pollutants | Nuts | Organic synthesis | Waste to wealth', citedby_count=75, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NFU', fund_no='163020139', fund_sponsor='Nanjing Forestry University'),\n",

This contribution discloses the synthesis of two bismuth-based halide perovskites with chemical compositions Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs3Bi2Br9via a solvent-free mechanochemical process in a ball mill. The obtained perovskite powders were characterized via X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and absorption and photoluminescence (PL) steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy. Cs2AgBiBr6 was able to absorb more in the visible region (Eg = 2.12 eV) as compared to Cs3Bi2Br9 (Eg = 2.53 eV). Additionally, PL time decays were considerably longer for Cs2AgBiBr6 (τav = 740 ns) with respect to Cs3Bi2Br9 (τav = 0.3 ns). Both photo-systems were employed in the oxidation of vanillyl alcohol to vanillin, an aldehyde derivative, under UV or visible illumination. Moderate values of photocatalytic conversion (15-30%) were observed except for Cs2AgBiBr6 under visible light irradiation, where 95% conversion could be obtained after only 80 minutes of exposition. PL measurements with the fluorescent probe hydroethidine and electron spin resonance (ESR) demonstrated the formation of superoxide radical species (˙O2−) after photoexcitation, with a larger concentration observed for Cs2AgBiBr6 under visible light due to higher absorption and longer lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers. Time-resolved PL measurements of both catalysts mixed with vanillyl alcohol powder shed light on the oxidation step upon irradiation taking place due to a hole transfer process from the valence band of the catalysts.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=16, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='MCIU', fund_no='IJC2018-037348-I', fund_sponsor='Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades'),\n",

The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of anisole specifically represents a model reaction for the conversion of lignin to biofuels through the removal of the aromatic carbon-oxygen bonds. To date, a range of Ni-based catalysts have been reported as highly active systems for the HDO of anisole. However, there has been a substantial lack of consideration given to the environmental characteristics of these catalytic systems, in contrast with the scope of the sustainable production of biofuels. Herein, Ni-based SiO2 catalysts are prepared by a solventless and highly efficient mechanochemistry approach, having a considerably lower environmental impact as compared to standard impregnation methods. Importantly, scrap catalytic converters (SCATs) are employed as co-catalysts, proving the possibility of enhancing the catalytic HDO of anisole, with a scarcely exploited waste material. The results demonstrate that the combined use of Ni/SiO2 as catalysts and Ni/SCATs as co-catalysts remarkably boosts the rate of the conversion of anisole up to more than 50% by achieving an almost complete conversion of anisole in only 40 min instead of at 200 °C and 4\\xa0MPa H2.', authkeywords='anisole | biofuels | biomass | catalytic converters | hydrodeoxygenation | lignin | nickel', citedby_count=6, openaccess=1, freetoread='repositoryvor', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='RUDN University'),\n",

The growth mechanism of the hollow BiOCl nanocaps is elucidated, and the openings of BiOCl nanocaps can be precisely controlled by fine tuning their growth conditions. The non-centrosymmetric BiOCl nanocaps yield a pseudo-first-order degradation kinetic rate constant of up to 0.1217 min-1in the photodegradation of rhodamine-B, 7.8 times higher than that of common BiOCl nanoplates. This suggests that BiOCl nanocaps show excellent photocatalytic performance to degrade colored rhodamine B. Furthermore, the BiOCl nanocaps can be also extended in the photodegradation of colorless contaminants in industrial wastewater. More importantly, the micelle-directed growth strategy can be generalized to synthesize non-centrosymmetric BiOCl0.5Br0.5and BiOBr hollow nanocaps.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are a promising class due to their selective nature and high atom efficiency to transform complex molecules with high selectivity at a reduced cost. Another excellent feature of SACs is their tunable active sites, which can be easily altered by well-developed synthetic strategies based on their targeted reactions. This review summarizes recent studies on the applications of SACs in the selective transformation of biomass-derived feedstocks into value-added products. A major focus is given on the catalyst design principle and the unique catalytic activities of SACs in each reaction (e.g., hydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation, oxidation, etc.) with examples.

Then, high-temperature carbonization is used to convert it into a COF-derived nitrogen-doped carbon (CN) to obtain a series of Pd-CN catalysts with different Pd loadings. Among them, Pd-CN-2 (with 2.51 wt%) exhibits high activity in the MOR and EOR. Its activity in the MOR is 2.93 A mgPd−1 (much more active than Pd/C-0.20 A mgPd−1). In the EOR, it reached 5.44 A mgPd−1, 25 times higher than that of Pd/C (0.22 A mgPd−1). In addition, the catalyst shows superior stability in both the MOR and EOR, maintaining more than 90% of its initial mass activity after a 40 000 s stability test. Its high activity and stability are probably attributed to the extraordinary stability of COF-derived CN materials and the interaction between Pd and CN.

Therefore, greater attention has been devoted into finding the efficient solutions for adsorbing heavy metal ions. This review paper focuses on the synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from biomass and their application in the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions. Techniques to produce CNTs, benefits of modification with various functional groups to enhance sorption uptake, effects of operating parameters, and adsorption mechanisms are reviewed. Adsorption occurs via physical adsorption, electrostatic interaction, surface complexation, and interaction between functional groups and heavy metal ions. Moreover, factors such as pH level, CNTs dosage, duration, temperature, ionic strength, and surface property of adsorbents have been identified as the common factors influencing the adsorption of heavy metals. The oxygenated functional groups initially present on the surface of the modified CNTs are responsible towards the adsorption enhancement of commonly-encountered heavy metals such as Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Hg2+, and Cr6+. Despite the recent advances in the application of CNTs in environmental clean-up and pollution treatment have been demonstrated, major obstacles of CNTs such as high synthesis cost, the agglomeration in the post-treated solutions and the secondary pollution from chemicals in the surface modification, should be critically addressed in the future studies for successful large-scale applications of CNTs.', authkeywords='Adsorbents | Adsorption mechanism | Biomass waste | Carbon nanotubes | Functional groups | Heavy metal ions', citedby_count=146, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='RUDN University'),\n",

Physicochemical studies have been carried out using XRD, FTIR, SEM, and BET techniques. Electrochemical techniques (cyclic voltammetry, galvanic charge discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) have been employed to measure super-capacitance and EDLC properties. Results show that the gravimetric capacitance calculated from GCD results is 219 Fg−1 for ytterbiumand 169 Fg−1 for cerium-based nanocomposites at the current density of 1 A/g and scan rate of 2 mV/sec. The specific capacitance calculated for the ytterbium-based nanocomposite is 189 Fg−1 as compared to 125 Fg−1 for the cerium-based material.

Characterization studies pointed to the presence of well-dispersed and uniform PdO nanoparticles with very small particle sizes. Catalytic data showed that the incorporation of low Pd content (1-2 wt %) caused an increase in the conversion at shorter reaction times, with FUR conversion close to 95% and a F2A yield of 60%, after 3 h of reaction at 150 °C. However, at longer reaction times and higher temperatures, the high reactivity of F2A reduced product yields, accompanied by the formation of 2,2′-difuryl methane (DFM) via C-C coupling. Other parameters including the nature of oxidant and the strength of the base, play an important role in this catalytic process. The use of strong bases (NaOH or KOH) ameliorated activity, although they favored the formation of nondetected products, so it was necessary to use a softer base such as Na2CO3.

In this work, inspired by the successful growth of 2D borophene on Cu (111) surfaces [Nat. Nanotechnol., 2019,14(1), 44], we introduce a high density of one-dimensional copper/borophene interface sites for the C-C coupling reaction by using a framework of density functional theory calculations. Cu alone interacts very weakly with CO, while its synergistic interfacial interactions with boron atoms could significantly boost the CO binding strength, thus facilitating C-C coupling. The Cu-boron interface delivers an ultra-low kinetic energy barrier of only 0.42 eV for the CO dimerization step and a thermodynamic potential limiting step of only 0.61 V for the hydrogenation process toward ethanol production, inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction. The improved intrinsic catalytic activity can be ascribed to both the synergistic electronic and structural interactions between metal Cu and non-metal B atoms at the interface.

Different metal precursors (metal saltsversusMOF particles) were studied in order to explore their impact on the ultimate catalytic performance of the doped materials. Importantly, doping levels as low as <1 wt% led to significant catalytic improvements for selective mild oxidation reactions under microwave irradiation in a very short reaction time (3 min). Fe-doped materials (0.175 mol% catalyst) resulted in the highest yields, achieving a maximum conversion of 46% and 100% selectivity in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, and 61% conversion and 44% selectivity in the production of vanillin from isoeugenol. Results clearly indicated that the incorporation of Zr or Fe into the structure increased the total acidity of the support, which is then translated into an improved catalytic performance toward the studied oxidation reactions. The recyclability (up to 5 reuses without any treatment; although more reuses are possible after regeneration) of the doped catalysts pointed out their true potential applicability in a sustainable manner.

Hence, in this work, the direct synthesis of a phorphyrinic chromium-based MOF, Cr-PCN-600 (PCN stands for Porous Coordination Network) under solvothermal conditions is reported. The resulting Cr-MOF exhibits high surface area, permanent porosity, and broad light absorption wavelength range.

Their structural mobility is also highlighted, since they are complex molecules that can be modified by changing their structure or the elements that compose them to model their size, charge density, redox potentials, acidity, and solubility.

Despite the unique properties that both its components (eggshell, ES, and eggshell membrane, ESM) possess, it is very often discarded without further use. This review article aims to summarize the recent reports utilizing eggshell waste for very diverse purposes, stressing the need to use a mechanochemical approach to broaden its applications. The most studied field with regards to the potential use of eggshell waste is catalysis. Upon proper treatment, it can be used for turning waste oils into biodiesel and moreover, the catalytic effect of eggshell-based material in organic synthesis is also very beneficial. In inorganic chemistry, the eggshell membrane is very often used as a templating agent for nanoparticles production. Such composites are suitable for application in photocatalysis. These bionanocomposites are also capable of heavy metal ions reduction and can be also used for the ozonation process. The eggshell and its membrane are applicable in electrochemistry as well. Due to the high protein content and the presence of functional groups on the surface, ESM can be easily converted to a high-performance electrode material. Finally, both ES and ESM are suitable for medical applications, as the former can be used as an inexpensive Ca2+ source for the development of medications, particles for drug delivery, organic matrix/mineral nanocomposites as potential tissue scaffolds, food supplements and the latter for the treatment of joint diseases, in reparative medicine and vascular graft producing. For the majority of the above-mentioned applications, the pretreatment of the eggshell waste is necessary. Among other options, the mechanochemical pretreatment has found an inevitable place. Since the publication of the last review paper devoted to the mechanochemical treatment of eggshell waste, a few new works have appeared, which are reviewed here to underline the sustainable character of the proposed methodology.

Animal bone wastes have attracted much attention as environmentally friendly heterogeneous catalysts for chemical transformations such as transesterification, oxidation, and biofuel production, owing to the substantial availability of valuable hydroxyapatite (HAp) in their structure. Most catalysts based on bone can be prepared easily by calcination. High-temperature calcination yields highly active catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts prepared from these renewable sources could also simply be reused and recovered without any important loss of catalytic performance.

Herein, trifunctional electrocatalysts comprising cobalt nanoparticles uniformly embedded in porous carbon networks were fabricated using a spent tea leaves (STL) template via a one-step carbothermal-reduction strategy at different temperatures. STL played a synthetic dual role in constructing nanocatalysts by acting as efficient scavengers to trap cobalt cations via electrostatic interactions and as carbon sources to generate a porous carbon matrix. Full characterization of the as-synthesized materials revealed the crucial effect of temperature on the crystallinity, surface area, number of surface defects and interfacial charge distribution properties. Furthermore, the trifunctional catalytic activity of the nanoparticles can be finely tuned by varying the carbonization temperature. Co@PC-7 displayed a superior trifunctional catalytic activity exhibiting an excellent performance for hydrogen production with an overpotential of 153 mV (vs. RHE) to achieve 10 mA cm-2, and an impressive bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity with an ultralow potential difference between OER and ORR (ΔE = η10 - E1/2) of 0.69 V, which is one of the lowest values reported in the literature for transition metal nanocatalysts.

Novel ion battery anode materials (NIBAMs) are attracting a growing attention due to the capacity limitation of the classic graphite anodes, which provide low specific- and rate-capacity, and safety issues. Nevertheless, the electrochemical performance of NIBAMs such as the capacity, cyclability, rate capability, voltage profiles, and safety are strongly dependent on the structural and morphological evolution, phase transformation, ion diffusion, and electrode/electrolyte interface reconstruction during charge-discharge cycling and storage. In-depth understanding of the electrochemical process of NIBAMs is essential for optimizing their preparation and application conditions, and exploring NIBAMs. Traditional electroanalytical methods, such as charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are utilized to research the capacity, resistance, rate capability and cyclability of NIBAMs. Recently, rapid progress and development in hyphenated techniques by coupling with X-ray, electron, scanning probe, optics, neutron, and magnetic techniques have provided extensive insights into the nature of structural evolution and morphological changes of NIBAMs, and electrode/electrolyte interface.

Furfural (FUR) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) are surely the most used furan-based feedstocks since their chemical structure allows the preparation of various high-value-added chemicals.

Herein, we report an economic and simple strategy to prepare a novel photocatalyst by using eggshell as template and support. Rod-like Copper sulphide (CuS) nanoparticles are uniformly coated on the surface of porous eggshell to form CaCO3/CuS nanocomposite. Under NIR irradiation, the nanocomposite shows a high catalytic activity for 4-nirophenol (4-NP) reduction and strong photothermal ablation behavior against bacteria. A 98% degradation rate can be completed in 15 min, superior to that in the absence of Near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation. Bacterial inactivation ability is also closely related with photocatalyst concentrations and NIR power. A possible mechanism is suggested, which is attributed to the synergistic photocatalytic, photothermal, photodynamic effects.

In this contribution we have prepared and tested metal transition based catalysts (namely Ni3N and Ni nanoparticles) for the hydroconversion of levulinic acid (LA) as a model reaction. LA is useful also to produce valuable N-substituted pyrrolidones. Nanoparticles were prepared via a greener synthesis, using urea and metal salts, and have an average diameter of ∼30 nm (as ascertained by XRD and TEM studies). The main product of the levulinic acid hydroconversion was 1-ethyl-5-methylpyrrolidin-2-one. While this product was always the preferred one when Ni was used, Ni3N favoured the formation of the main product only in a shorter reaction time (below 1 h) with very high selectivity (up to 55% conversion), while a secondary product was formed in a longer time. The stability of the catalysts was also tested. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such a reaction is tested using transition metals and metal nitrides, with very promising results.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=9, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr='RSC', fund_no='RM1802-1846', fund_sponsor='Royal Society of Chemistry'),\n",

Currently, no diagnostic method is available for identifying patients at risk of VC development; the pathology is detected when the process is irreversible. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from endothelial cells might promote VC. Therefore, their evaluation and characterization could be useful for designing new diagnostic tools. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether microvesicles (MVs) from endothelial cells damaged by uremic toxin and indoxyl sulfate (IS) could induce calcification in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VMSCs). Besides, we have also analyzed the molecular mechanisms by which these endothelial MVs can promote VC development. Endothelial damage has been evaluated according to the percentage of senescence in endothelial cells, differential microRNAs in endothelial cells, and the amount of MVs released per cell. To identify the role of MVs in VC, VSMCs were treated with MVs from IS-treated endothelial cells. Calcium, inflammatory gene expression, and procalcification mediator levels in VSMCs were determined.

The photocatalytic performance of synthesized samples was tested for degradation of acetaminophen (ACT) under visible light irradiation. ACT removal efficiency was directly depended on the GO-level in composite and the maximum photocatalytic yield was achieved for the sample with GO concentration of 0.2 g/L. Formation of Ag2S in the nanocomposite was confirmed using XRD, XPS and UV–Vis DRS and photoluminescence (PL) measurement. XRD patterns pointed to the existence of a wurtzite structure for all samples and by silver loading, Ag2S peaks were visualized in the XRD patterns, with increased intensity by rising the Ag content in the solution precursor. EDS and XPS data indicated the presence of sulfur and silver in the form of Ag+ and S2−. A considerable red shift in absorption edge and reduce in PL emission peak intensity was observed over the introduction of Ag in the precursor solution due to the existence of Ag2S. The Ag2S-ZnO@rGO composites indicated enhanced photocatalytic performance toward degradation of ACT under visible light compared to bare ZnO and ZnO@rGO. The underlying mechanism has been investigated based on the results of UV–Vis DRS, PL and reactive species scavenging experiments. The improved photocatalytic activity is mainly ascribed to better light harvesting and increased photogenerated electron-hole separation. Ag2S play an important role in the composite due to the synergistic effect of Ag2S and rGO, which not only improve the light harvesting but also reduce the charge recombination. The as-made catalyst indicated a great potential for recycling, suggesting the potentially large-scale applications of prepared catalyst for emerging water contaminants and wastewater treatment.

For this purpose, different solid reagents were screened (Na2CO3, BaCO3, Li2CO3, CoCO3, K2CO3 and CaCO3), and the results were compared with other extraction techniques: conventional Soxhlet, ultrasound (UAE) and microwave (MAE). The comparison was carried out based on total dissolved solids (TDS), total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant power (AOP). As-obtained extracts were analysed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (GC and GC–MS) to characterize their composition. In conventional Soxhlet extraction different solvents (water, ethanol and methanol) were tested. It was demonstrated that ethanol provided the best results. Mechanochemical processing resulted in comparable TPC (75.54 GAE g−1 extract) to Soxhlet. Therefore, MCAE is a step forward since, for the same TPC as conventional extraction, the total extraction time (mechanochemical pretreatment and extraction in ethanol) is reduced more than 10 times. The main phenolic compounds present in the extracts were identified as eugenol, methyleugenol and elemicin. Although the results obtained by means of UAE and MAE could be better than those of MCAE, the present study proposes the substitution of conventional extraction by mechanochemistry since the same yields were obtained.', authkeywords='Antioxidants | Bay leaves | Mechanochemistry | Microwave | Phenolic | Ultrasound', citedby_count=39, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='ESF', fund_no='RYC-2015-17109', fund_sponsor='European Social Fund'),\n",

The double perovskites or \"elpasolites\" with the formula A2BB′X6 arise as an alternative to avoid the use of Pb, however, not many of the theoretically predicted structures have been synthesized so far due to several synthetic issues, such as, the formation of stable side products. Herein, we report the synthesis of three double perovskites, Cs2AgBiBr6, MA2TlBiBr6 and Cs2AgSbBr6, through a highly efficient and reproducible mechanochemical approach: the high energy ball milling. This synthetic approach does not require the use of organic solvents, so it is a greener method compared to those reported for other double perovskites. The Cs2AgBiBr6 and MA2TlBiBr6 double perovskites were synthesized with high purity as proved by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements. However, the Cs2AgSbBr6 double perovskite was obtained in mixture with Cs3Sb2Br9, a side product of the reaction. Several attempts to prepare the Cs2AgSbBr6 double perovskite by using other synthetic methods have been unsuccessful due to the low formation enthalpy of the Cs3Sb2Br9 side product and only the hydrothermal method afforded Cs2AgSbBr6 in mixture with other compounds. We believe that the low temperature required in the ball milling synthesis is the key factor that allows the formation of the antimony double perovskite. Cs2AgSbBr6 is a brown powder with a bandgap energy of 1.93 eV as shown with diffuse reflectance measurements. The three powders exhibit a very high stability with no changes at all in the crystal structure after several months of storage at room temperature and ambient humidity.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=65, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='MECD', fund_no='FPU14/05920', fund_sponsor='Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte'),\n",

Herein, CuO/ZnO/eggshell (CZ/ES) composites were rationally fabricated by using waste eggshell as a template. After a simple deposition and calcination process, the CuO and ZnO nanoparticles were evenly distributed over the surface of the CaCO3. The (photo)catalytic activity and antibacterial properties of the nanocomposites were subsequently investigated. The results showed that the CZ/ES nanocomposite exhibited a superior catalytic reduction and antibacterial activity. The catalytic reduction reaction rate constant Kapp of 4-nitrophenol under the irradiation of UV-vis light was calculated to be approximately five times higher than that obtained in the absence of light irradiation. Besides, the CZ/ES nanocomposite exhibited significant antibacterial property for the destruction of E. coli and S. aureus. The enhanced performance in the (photo)catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol and bacterial disinfection of CZ/ES may be attributed to the strong reactant absorbance capacity, large amounts of reaction sites, and improved separation efficiency of the electrons.

X-ray diffractograms of the synthesized samples revealed that the sample AM41-2H, obtained from kaolin leached for 2 h (MC7-2H), presented the best structural arrangement due to the presence of 2θ angles close to 2.32°, a specific surface area of 1016 m2·g-1, a pore volume of 0.80 cm3·g-1, and a pore diameter of 3.14 nm, which are characteristic of Al-MCM-41. A sample of AM41-2H was functionalized with 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MTPS) (5 mmol MTPS/g AM41-2H). To eliminate excess unaltered MTPS on the surface of the material, the functionalized aluminosilicate (AM41-2H-F) was subjected to a purification step. The organic functional group that remained in the molecular sieve (-SH) was then oxidized to its corresponding acid group (-SO3H) to form stronger acid sites. Then, the heterogeneous catalyst obtained (AM41-2H-O) was tested in an esterification reaction of oleic acid with methanol and in an esterification reaction of an industrial waste from palm oil refinement (DDPO), which is generated during the deodorization process of palm oil. Both reactions were carried out for 2 h at 130 °C, with a fatty acid/methanol molar ratio of 1:30 and addition of 5% catalyst to the mass of fatty acid. The results obtained revealed that the conversion to esters from oleic acid and DDPO was 99% and 98%, respectively, in contrast to the uncatalyzed reaction, which achieved only 15% conversion. The catalysts used in the reactions were recovered and reused in the same conditions as the initial reactions, which showed conversions in this first cycle of catalyst reuse of 98% for oleic acid and 81% for DDPO, proving the efficiency of the catalyst synthesized from industrial kaolin waste.', authkeywords='Al-MCM-41 | Deodorization waste | Esterification | Waste mining', citedby_count=13, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='CAPES', fund_no='2018/ 212', fund_sponsor='Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior'),\n",

The resulting catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, porosimetry, and magnetic susceptibility. The magnetic nanocatalysts were tested in the selective oxidative cleavage reaction of isoeugenol and vanillyl alcohol to vanillin.

In this work, ET rates of recombinant CotA laccases have been drastically improved by an immobilization process on sulfonic group-modified graphitic carbon nitride (Sg-CN) materials. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed that the enzymes undergo striking conformational changes onto graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN), adopting an electrochemically inactive configuration while retain their nativelike structure with a superb ET efficiency on Sg-CN surfaces. In fact, the resulting CotA laccase/Sg-CN biomaterial displayed an ET rate constant of (12 ± 0.5) s-1, the highest value reported to date for a direct electron-transfer reaction of multicopper oxidases attached to carbon-based materials. Importantly, the combined parallel tempering Monte Carlo (PTMC) and all-atom molecular dynamics (AAMD) theoretical calculations proved CotA incorporation in a highly ordered array with an overall positive surface density composed of lysine and arginine domains in contact with net negatively charged Sg-CN surfaces, which promoted a 1200-fold improvement in the free enzyme ET rate constant. An ET pathway has been put forward that takes into account the orientation of CotA laccase on the Sg-CN surface. Additionally, CotA laccase/Sg-CN biomaterial was tested as an amperometric biosensor delivering outstanding bioelectrocatalytic activities in the oxidation of catechol and syringol, which are relevant emerging pollutants.

This work proposes citrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and HER. The capping ligand has a great influence on their resulting electrocatalytic performance. A simple ligand exchange method based on concentration gradients has been optimized.

Truly, ultrasound irradiation has emerged as a fast technique for promoting efficient derivatization of a silica surface with organic moieties at low temperature. Three different β-CD silica-grafted derivatives have been obtained, and the ability of β-CD to direct and bind Cu when CD is bonded to silica has been studied. A detailed characterization has been performed using TGA, phenolphthalein titration, FT-IR, diffuse reflectance (DR), DR UV-Vis, as well as the inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) of the β-CD silica-grafted systems and the relative Cu-supported catalysts. Spectroscopic characterization monitored the different steps of the reaction, highlighting qualitative differences in the properties of amino-derivatized precursors and final products. In order to ensure that the Cu-β-CD silica catalyst is efficient and robust, its applicability in Cu(II)-catalyzed alkyne azide reactions in the absence of a reducing agent has been explored.

First, the role of catalysis in sustainable chemistry is highlighted. Researchers and those working in industry are continually searching for highly active, efficient and stable catalysts. Nanoscience and nanotechnology have undoubtedly contributed to this, and have gone beyond the classic homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, developing catalysts that exhibit unprecedented properties and performances. The mechanisms behind these nano-effects remain unclear, and there is still space for improvement in the design of nanocatalysts. Current design strategies are based on the synthesis of highly active sites at the nanoscale and also on tuning the micro-environment by hosting them in confined spaces in porous nanomaterials. Advanced characterization of nanoparticles is essential to making the design and synthesis more rational. Nano-effects include structural changes and confinement and have a considerable impact on the energy levels, which can alter the physical, electronic and optical properties of nanomaterials. Prominent catalytic applications in sustainable chemistry include the production of bulk and fine chemicals in classic petroleum-based refineries and in biorefineries starting from biomass, carbon dioxide conversion, photocatalytic water splitting, reformation and the development of advanced sensor materials.

SEM, XRD and ICP-OES results show that a different number of Ag NPs are uniformly distributed on the surface of eggshells, which are defined as Ag1/eggshell (10.8%), Ag2/eggshell (19.9%) and Ag3/eggshell (34.3%) catalysts according to the amounts of loaded Ag NPs. Then, the activity between the three catalysts and the pure Ag NPs was assessed based on the catalytic oxidation of benzene. Our results show that the Ag NP loaded-eggshell catalysts exhibit superior catalytic activity compared with the pure Ag NPs. Considering the balance between the cost and catalytic performance, the Ag2/eggshell catalyst was selected as the optimum research object in the subsequent work. The Ag2/eggshell catalyst calcined at 500 °C exhibited excellent catalytic activity, which is assigned to the unique channel structure of eggshell, good low-temperature reducibility, and high dispersion of particles (sizes effects) on the surface of eggshell as well as the synergetic interaction between the Ag NPs and eggshell. Furthermore, the Ag2/eggshell catalyst exhibited predominant stability even after 200 h of on-stream reaction. The reaction mechanism is put forward based on the in situ FTIR experimental results, in which some carboxylate intermediate species are confirmed. Accordingly, the waste eggshell is considered as a promising supporting material for the large-scale synthesis of noble metal catalyst with high catalytic performance and stability for VOC oxidation.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=96, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSFC', fund_no='2017G023', fund_sponsor='National Natural Science Foundation of China'),\n",

To date, all these studies employed Aquivion PFSA in powder form and the impact of shaping Aquivion PFSA on its catalytic performances has never been reported, although this aspect is of prime importance for implementation on a larger scale. Often considered as a matter of practical interest in the current literature, the shaping of a catalyst is actually mandatory and is clearly a key research topic for catalyst design and chemical engineering. Here, we explored the effect of shaping Aquivion PFSA on (1) its catalytic performances (i.e. yield, reaction rate and space time yield), (2) its ease of recovery at the end of the reaction (i.e. filtration, recyclability) and (3) its deactivation rate. In particular, we found that shaping Aquivion PFSA into micropellets was a good compromise (between powder and macropellets) to maintain acceptable catalytic performances while considerably facilitating the recovery of Aquivion PFSA at the end of the reaction. Last but not least, by properly controlling the reaction conditions, it was possible to limit the deactivation of Aquivion PFSA shaped into micropellets, a recurrent problem in catalytic carbohydrate processing.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=6, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='COST', fund_no='FP1306', fund_sponsor='European Cooperation in Science and Technology'),\n",

We proved the formation of a polybenzoxazine structure and found that p-phenylenediamine not only participates in the condensation but also catalyzes the polymerization of phloroglucinol and formaldehyde based on the characterization by FTIR, Raman, NMR, and XPS. The monodisperse polymer nanospheres are so uniform that they can form three-dimensional periodic structures by self-assembly. In addition, these polymer nanospheres can be pseudomorphically converted to the corresponding uniform nitrogen-doped carbon spheres by pyrolysis due to the excellent thermal stability (48.6 wt% at 1000 °C based on the measurement of TGA) of such polybenzoxazine-based polymers. The high nitrogen doping level of 9.77 wt% in the carbon matrix was achieved.

Accordingly, approaches to increase the carbon-chain length or carbon atom number have been developed as crucial catalytic routes for upgrading biomass into energy-intensive fuels and chemicals. The primary focus of this review is to systematically describe the recent examples on the selective synthesis of long-chain oxygenates via different C-C coupling catalytic processes, such as Aldol condensation, hydroalkylation/alkylation, oligomerization, ketonization, Diels-Alder, Guerbet, and acylation reactions.

Lamellar double hydroxides or hydrotalcites are materials having excellent basic properties and high surface areas. As their surface properties have been used as bifunctional catalysts allowing the incorporation of metals and depending on the calcination temperature, these materials may exhibit Lewis or Brönsted basic sites. Additionally, they are widely used in various organic synthesis reactions. Objective: This contribution has been aimed to provide a compilation of the application of hydrotalcites as basic materials in organic synthesis, with a particular emphasis on multicomponent reactions. Conclusion: Hydrotalcites act as heterogeneous catalysts that conduct highly efficient processes in short reaction times and with the advantage of their easy recovery and reuse without significant loss of their catalytic activity. In addition, due to the modification of their structural and chemical properties, they are catalysts with multiple applications in organic synthesis such as Michael addition reactions, dehydrogenation reactions of alcohols, Knoevenagel condensations, reduction reactions, oxidations, epoxidations, multicomponent reactions, among others.

Numerous catalytic routes have been developed for the conversion of bio-succinate to a wide range of chemical compounds and bio-based polymers. However, most of them have been demonstrated from pure isolated succinic acid, but the isolation and purification of succinic acid from fermentation broths is no mean task and requires a considerable amount of energy.

A highly efficient and selective removal method has been long sought for heavy metal ions wastewater treatment. In this study, a highly monodispersed polyethylenimine-chitosan (PEI-CS) biosorbent, synthesized by an integrated process with facile microfluidic emulsion, chemical crosslinking, solvent extraction and chemical modification, was used as an efficient adsorbent to remove heavy metal ion from contaminated water.

Only MVs from senescent ECs, and from elderly subjects' plasma, induced calcification. This ability correlated with these types of MVs' carriage of: a) increased quantities of annexins (which might act as nucleation sites for calcification), b) increased quantities of bone-morphogenic protein, and c) larger Ca contents.

However, chlorine as a disinfectant is capable of reacting with inorganic and organic constituents of water to produce hazardous chlorinated disinfection byproducts (Cl-DBPs). Brominated and iodinated DBPs (Br-DBPs and I-DBPs), which are more genotoxic and cytotoxic than their chlorinated analogs, may also be formed in the presence of bromide (Br−) and iodide (I−) in water. This paper first reviews the formation of Cl-DBPs and Br-DBPs by considering the rates of the reactions of chlorine with natural organic matter (NOM) and its model compounds. The reactions of chlorine with Br− and I− yield acids (HOBr/OBr− and HOI/OI−, respectively), which subsequently either disproportionate or react with NOM to form Br-DBPs and iodate/I-DBPs, respectively. The mechanisms of the formation of DBPs in the presence of metal ions and metal oxides (which already exist in water and are released from pipes) and nanoparticles (NPs) (input from the use of consumer products) are then reviewed. Water parameters (pH, cationic and anionic constituents, and types and concentration of NOM) also influence the production of DBPs. Plausible mechanisms of the influence of metal ions on the formation of bromate involve complexation of metal ions with moieties of NOM. Metal oxides catalyze the reactions accountable for the formation of Br-DBPs. Only a few studies have been conducted on the effect of NPs on DBP production during chlorination. More research is needed to understand the variation in NP chemistry under environmental conditions (pH, dissolution, and light), and whether NPs influence DBP formation during chlorination.', authkeywords='Bromate | Brominated compounds | Copper ions | Copper oxide | Iodinated compounds | Mechanism | Oxidation | Silver nanoparticles', citedby_count=76, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None),\n",

This research attempts to fabricate novel electroconductive and mechanically stable nanocomposites via an electroless deposition (ELD) technique using electrically insulating materials.

Considerable variations in composite phases with filler inclusion exist. The Cu crystallite growth onto Al2O3 was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) depicts a uniform Cu coating on Al2O3, while homogeneous filler dispersion is exhibited in the case of composites. The electrical behavior of composites is enhanced drastically (7.7 × 10-5 S/cm) upon incorporation of Cu-Al2O3 into an insulating polymer matrix (4.4 × 10-16 S/cm). Moreover, mechanical (Young's modulus, tensile strength and % elongation at break) and thermal (thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), derivative thermogravimetry (DTG), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)) properties of the nanocomposites also improve substantially.

Most pretreatments of lignocellulosic biomass into chemicals or biofuels are currently based on expensive chemical and energy consuming processes, which entail significant resource consumption (e.g. water) and generate a number of residual streams. In this work, two innovative dry fractionation technologies (physical fractionation: turbo- and electrostatic separation of lignocellulose particles) have been developed for rice straw \"RS\" fractionation and bioconversion to sugars and biofuels. Turbo-fractionation technology (TF-T) comprises particle separation according to their size and density, whereas electrostatic fractionation technology (EF-T) is based on the separation of particles according to their surface properties (chemical composition and charges). TF-T and EF-T are suitable for producing lignocellulose fractions displaying very different structures, biochemical compositions and reactive surfaces without extensively damaging the raw fibers as well as minimizing waste generation (E-factor: 0.7-0.75). The produced fractions could be hydrolyzed, being able to produce large quantities of glucose (250-280 g kg-1 RS) after 72 h of hydrolysis and subsequently ethanol (130-150 g kg-1 RS) after fermentation. TF-T and EF-T can therefore improve the economic feasibility by low energy consumption and produce reactive lignocellulose particles with different physicochemical structures in a short time, which can be easily converted to biofuels, minimizing waste (no effluent generation).

Excited electron-hole pairs are generated upon light irradiation of a wide-band gap semiconductor which can be applied to solar cells to generate electricity or in chemical processes to create/degrade specific compounds.

The reaction was catalysed by different supported metal nanoparticles on mesoporous Al-SBA-15 including -nickel (2, 5 and 10. wt.%), palladium (2. wt.%), platinum (2. wt.%) and ruthenium (2. wt.%). Three main products were indentified in the proposed lignin valorisation protocol, namely a bio-oil, a bio-char and a fraction of residual lignin. These have been characterised by means of several techniques including GC-MS, MALDI-TOF, HPSEC and elemental analysis in order to evaluate the extension and mechanism of the selected depolymerisation approach. In this work, the objective has been the maximisation of bio-oil yield as well as its content in phenolic monomeric compounds. All tested catalysts exhibited improved results as compared to the blank depolymerisation (without catalyst), demonstrating a synergetic effect of metal nanoparticles in lignin hydrogenolysis. The most abundant phenolic products observed in most studied catalysts have been solvent derived products such as diethyl phthalate and butyl-octyl phthalate ester. Interestingly, phenolic compounds derived from lignin were also obtained including mesitol and syringaldehyde as well as desaspidinol and aspidinol, depending on the utilised solvent in the systems. The bio-oil obtained was primarily composed of monomers, dimers and trimers. Biochar yield was relatively high in most cases (>35% in some cases) due to existing oligomerisation reactions under the investigated conditions except for the case of the use of formic acid which gave no biochar in the process. Residual lignin content was often high and repolymerisation was observed in some cases.

Food waste valorization is one of the current research areas that has attracted a great deal of attention over the past few years as a potential alternative to the disposal of a wide range of residues in landfill sites. In particular, the development of environmentally sound and innovative strategies to process such waste is an area of increasing importance in our current society. Landfill, incineration and composting are common, mature technologies for waste disposal. However, they are not satisfactory to treating organic waste due to the generation of toxic methane gas and bad odor, high energy consumption and slow reaction kinetics. In fact, research efforts have also been oriented on novel technologies to decompose organic waste. However, no valuable product is generated from the decomposition process. Instead of disposing and decomposing food waste, recent research has focused on its utilization as energy source (e.g., for bioethanol and biodiesel production). Organic waste is also useful to generate useful organic chemicals via biorefinery or white biotechnology (e.g., succinic acid and/or bio-plastics). This article is aimed to summarize recent development of waste valorization strategies for the sustainable production of chemicals, materials, and fuels through the development of green production strategies.

It involves ultrafiltration as a fractionation process to separate different molecular weight lignin fractions followed by a hydrogen-free, mild, hydrogenolytic, heterogeneously catalyzed methodology assisted by microwave irradiation to obtain simple phenolic, monomeric products by depolymerization using a nickel-based catalyst. The main products obtained were desaspidinol, syringaldehyde, and syringol; this proves the efficiency of the depolymerization conditions applied. The concentration of these observed compounds increased when the molecular weights of the lignin fractions increased. The applied depolymerization conditions, which take advantage of the use of formic acid as a hydrogen-donating solvent, did not generate any biochar in the systems.

A multidisciplinary approach is needed to produce suitable alternatives—such as renewable resources—for a more sustainable future. One of the most promising and widely available renewable feedstocks is biomass, which has significant potential for conversion to materials, fuels, and chemicals. In addition, nanomaterials can be designed for a range of applications including energy storage, fuel production, and nanocatalysis. Designing nanomaterials for the valorization of biomass and waste feedstocks is a major step in advancing the application of nanomaterials and helping to move us toward the goal of a sustainable economy. Producing Fuels and Fine Chemicals from Biomass Using Nanomaterials offers a wide-ranging approach to the development of innovative nanomaterials for biomass conversion and the production of energy and high-added-value chemicals, including biochemicals, biomaterials, and biofuels. The book is organized into three parts according to nanomaterial applications: Nanomaterials for Energy Storage and Conversion, Biofuels from Biomass Valorization Using Nanomaterials, and Production of High-Added-Value Chemicals from Biomass Using Nanomaterials. Providing a multidisciplinary perspective, this book covers the most important aspects of topics such as solar energy storage, design of carbonaceous nanomaterials as heterogeneous catalysts for producing biofuels, catalytic reforming of biogas into syngas using a range of nanoparticles, and biofuels production from waste oils and fats.

Our society is currently experiencing constraints imposed by our resource system, which drives industry to increase its overall efficiency by improving existing processes or finding new uses for waste. Food supply chain waste emerged as a resource with a significant potential to be employed as a raw material for the production of fuels and chemicals given the abundant volumes globally generated, its contained diversity of functionalised chemical components and the opportunity to be utilised for higher value applications. The present manuscript is aimed to provide a general overview of the current and most innovative uses of food supply chain waste, providing a range of worldwide case-studies from around the globe. These studies will focus on examples illustrating the use of citrus peel, waste cooking oil and cashew shell nut liquid in countries such as China, the UK, Tanzania, Spain, Greece or Morocco. This work emphasises 2<sup>nd</sup> generation food waste valorisation and re-use strategies for the production of higher value and marketable products rather than conventional food waste processing (incineration for energy recovery, feed or composting) while highlighting issues linked to the use of food waste as a sustainable raw material. The influence of food regulations on food supply chain waste valorisation will also be addressed as well as our society\\'s behavior towards food supply chain waste. \"There was no ways of dealing with it that have not been known for thousands of years.

Arthrospira platensis (Spirulina) is known for its nutritional benefits with very low lipid content. However, among all other algae, spirulina is the most easy to cultivate due to its inherent resistance to contamination and environmental changes. The presented work aims to determine the best culture medium to achieve an optimum lipid content for microalgae in view of a subsequent exploration for biodiesel production. This was conducted by means of a two step microalgal oil extraction followed by a conventional acid-catalysed esterification of the released fatty acids. Algal growth, biomass and lipid content were compared for Spirulina grown under six different culture media. 1) culture medium of complete nutrition (CONTROL); 2) nitrogen and phosphorus-deprived [NP(-)]; 3) nitrogen-deprived [N(-)]; 4) phosphorus-deprived [P(-)]; 5) nitrogen and phosphorus-limited [NPL] and; 6) nitrogen-deprived and phosphorus-limited [N(-)PL]. With the minimum possible dried biomass (0.4780 g L -1), the largest lipid content (ca. 20%) was achieved in spirulina grown under nitrogen-deprived and phosporous-limited conditions [N(-)PL]. Dried biomass from Spirulina grown under two opposite culture media: complete nutrition [CONTROL]; and nitrogen and phosphorous deprived [NP(-)], were utilised for biodiesel preparation after oil extraction.

One effective strategy for the processing of complex biomass feedstocks involves previous conversion into simpler compounds (platform molecules) which are more easily transformed in subsequent upgrading reactions. Lactic acid and levulinic acid are two of these relevant biomass derivatives which can easily be derived from biomass sources by means of microbial and/or chemical routes. The present paper intends to cover the most relevant catalytic strategies designed today for the conversion of these molecules into advanced biofuels (e.g. higher alcohols, liquid hydrocarbon fuels) which are fully compatible with the existing hydrocarbons-based transportation infrastructure. The routes described herein involve: (i) deoxygenation reactions which are required for controlling reactivity and for increasing energy density of highly functionalized lactic and levulinic acid combined with (ii) CC coupling reactions for increasing molecular weight of less-oxygenated reactive intermediates. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.', authkeywords='γ-Valerolactone | Advanced biofuels | Aqueous-phase processing | Biomass | Ketonization | Lactic acid | Levulinic acid', citedby_count=107, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='MINECO', fund_no='P10-FQM-6711', fund_sponsor='Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España'),\n",

Biomass is considered by experts the only sustainable source of energy and organic carbon for our industrial society, and it has the potential to displace petroleum in the production of chemicals and liquid transportation fuels. However, the transition from a petroleum-based economy to one based on biomass requires new strategies since the petrochemical technologies, well-developed over the last century, are not valid to process the biomass-derived compounds. Unlike petroleum feedstocks, biomass derived platform molecules possess a high oxygen content that gives them low volatility, high solubility in water, high reactivity and low thermal stability, properties that favour the processing of these resources by catalytic aqueous-phase technologies at moderate temperatures. This tutorial review is aimed at providing a general overview of processes, technologies and challenges that lie ahead for a range of different aqueous-phase transformations of some of the key biomass-derived platform molecules into liquid fuels for the transportation sector and related high added value chemicals. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=716, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None),\n",

An alternative raw material for chemicals and biofuels production is lignocellulosic biomass. The conversion of biomass to biofuels begins with biomass pretreatment in which chemical and/or physical treatments are utilised to remove or weaken the tight linkages among cell-wall components, making biomass easier to degrade. The use of ionic liquids-salts (mixtures of cations and anions that melt below 100 °C) has been described as a new potentially viable development in this area due to the increasing interest in the use of such compounds to pretreat lignocellulosic materials and to catalyse the dissolution of cellulose. This manuscript aims to provide an overview on the major representative progress and development of the use of ionic liquids systems for biomass pretreatment and cellulose dissolution.

This novel product, which integrates glycerol as monoacylglycerols (MG) into the biofuels composition, can avoid the removal step/s of such byproduct, mandatory in the production of conventional biodiesel. A multi-factorial design and response surface methodology (RSM) were employed to evaluate the effects of several conditions (temperature, molar ratio of ethanol to oil and pH) on the conversion of sunflower oil into a blend of Fatty Acid Ethyl Esters (FAEE), MG and diacylglycerols (DG). The effects of water content and concentration of lipase on conversion into FAEE and MG were also studied.

Seawater tolerance experiments demonstrated that the specific growth rate of Actinobacillus succinogenes was only slightly affected when more than 60% synthetic seawater was used, but no major significant inhibition of cell growth and SA production were observed even when fresh water was replaced by 100% synthetic seawater. The possibility of replacing a semi-defined medium with fresh water by wheat-derived media with natural seawater was carried out sequentially. Results showed that besides the usage as a water source, seawater also can be used as a mineral supplement to the wheat-derived media, forming a nutrient-complete medium for succinic acid production. In a fermentation using only wheat-derived medium and natural seawater, 49 g L-1 succinic acid was produced with a yield of 0.94 g per g and a productivity of 1.12 g L-1 h -1. Interestingly, compounds present in seawater had a major effect on rates of reactions of a range of transformations of SA including esterifications and amidations in comparison with reactions run under similar conditions using distilled water. While salts and related compounds improved the rates of reaction in the amidation of SA compared to plain water, a significant reduction in activity and catalyst deactivation was found in the esterifications of SA using Starbon® acids as catalysts. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=68, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None),\n",

Vegetable oils are the main feedstocks employed for its preparation but used vegetable oil and animal fats are currently considered one of the most attractive feedstocks for biodiesel production due to their lower market value in comparison with virgin oils alongside the fact that the material can be recycled from other industrial sectors. In this study, biodiesel-like biofuels are prepared from waste oils containing high concentrations of fatty acids, by using a family of acidic mesoporous carbonaceous materials denoted as starbon acids under both conventional heating and microwave irradiation. The solid acids are found to catalyze both the esterification of the free fatty acids in the waste oil with methanol and the transesterification of the triglycerides in the oil to give biodiesel and glycerol. starbon, SO 3H is found to be the most active catalyst under the investigated reaction conditions from a range of solid acids including zeolites and similar sulfonated carbonaceous materials.

Jatropha seeds are rich sources of hydrocarbons (27.0 to 48.5 % oil content) and the kernels can yield 46-58% of semidry oil. Information on various biofuel feedstocks indicate this non-edible oilseed plant could be converted to efficient biofuel crops by biotechnologically rendering it less toxic. A major concern for the extended use of jatropha seems to be the lack of knowledge on its potential yield under sub-optimal and marginal conditions. The introduction of jatropha for varied purposed faced a limited success due to unreliable seeds and oils yields and low economic returns. Despite considerable investments and project being undertaken in many countries, there is a lack of reliable scientific data on the agronomy of jatropha with poorly documented information on relationship among yields and variables including soil, climate, crops management and genetic material is poorly documented. In this work, we report a series of biotechnological methodologies to selection, in vitro propagation and plant breeding of jatropha curcas for the sustainable production of biodiesel. An overview of the currently available information on the different research on the production of biodiesel using jatropha al raw material is also given in terms of catalysts and possible non-edible feedstocks to be utilised in the process. The most promising methodology may be the use of biocatalysts with the addition of acyl acceptors different to short alcohols because this addresses the problem by opening the possibility of obtaining a second generation of biodiesel that integrates glycerol into the biofuels composition. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Vitamin E is the main lipophilic antioxidant that inhibits peroxidation, especially if associated with \"natural\" moisturizers such as the lipids in olive oil and olive extract. Vegetable oils containing EFAs have proven to be of great use in the production of cosmetics as either active incipient or raw materials for the synthesis of novel compounds. EFAs are easily integrated into the skin\\'s hydro-lipid film and are nourishing, moisturizing, and protective. Some of these substances have been used for centuries yet can still meet the needs of today\\'s consumers. Apart from their moisturizing and soothing effects, and anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory function, these products reduce aging of the skin with their antioxidant, stabilizing action on the cellular membranes. Treatment with olive oil has no side effects. Olive oil does not burn or traumatize the skin. Several synthetic compounds have been used in the development of cosmetics to adulterate the many essential oils derived from natural sources; however, lessons must be learned from the previous failures of organic chemistry. Environmentally polluting chemicals approved by the Department of Transportation (DOT) were initially claimed to be safe. Several pharmaceutical drugs have been licensed only to be subsequently withdrawn due to their serious side effects. These failures demonstrate that although chemical principles may be useful in the development of synthetic cosmetics, the potential for serious side effects must be considered. © 2010 Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Its desirable criteria include high selectivity, being compatible with many types of functional groups, typical use without protection groups and strong bases, and introduction at relatively late stages of the total synthesis. However, its use is less common in large-scale manufacture due to their cost and availability of aromatic halides at scale. In addition, palladium contamination of pharmaceutical products has to be 10 ppm or less that is difficult to achieve without strenuous and typically wastefully remediation strategies in place.

The novel biofuel has similar physico-chemical properties compared to those of conventional biodiesel and/or petrodiesel, avoiding the production of glycerine as by-product. The biocatalyst was found to be strongly fixed to the inorganic support (87.5%). Nevertheless, the efficiency of the immobilised enzyme was reduced to less than half (42%) compared to that of the free PPL.

The immobilised enzyme showed a remarkable stability as well as a great reusability (more than 11 successive reuses) without a significant loss of its initial catalytic activity. Both immobilised and free enzyme exhibited the same reaction mechanism, according to the coincidental results in the Arrhenius parameters (Ln A and Ea).

In particular, those from the Mytilidae species are of great interest because biochemical investigations have shown that they can be sources of biological active substances which can have different applications (e.g. food additives). We report here the extraction of lipids from two different species of molluscs (Mytilus galloprovincialis L., Mediterranean mussel) and gastropods (Rapana venosa, hard-shell clam). The extracts were evaluated in terms of antioxidant and composition properties and their healing properties were tested on skin burns in Wistar rats. Our studies proved that the two lipid extracts contained a relatively complex distribution of compounds, in terms of characteristic indices, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and vitamins E and D. The presence of such compounds rendered the extracts very efficient in healing induced skin burns in Wistar rats. The histological analysis showed a reduction in the time of healing (12-13 and 13-15 days for the Mytilus galloprovincialis (L.) Rapana venosa extracts, respectively) compared to 20-22 for untreated animals, based on results from tissues and blood samples. Our investigations have been proved to be promising in terms of future potential applications of the extracts as skin-care products, cosmetics and/or pharmaceutical preparations owing to their dermorestitutive properties. © 2008 AOCS.', authkeywords='Lipid extracts | Mytilus galloprovincialis (L.) | Neopreol | Rapana venosa | Wound healing', citedby_count=43, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None),\n",

In this contribution, we follow the mechanism of templated synthesis of mesoporous silica in the nonfunctionalized parent system, for different ACN/water proportions. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of spin probes was employed to follow structural changes in the template structure during precipitation, while X-ray diffraction (XRD) and porosimetry determinations have in parallel reported on the time evolution of the mesoporous structure. Three solvent mixtures were studied, with largely different solvent compositions, and EPR data have shown that a 0.3 M dodecylamine (DDA) solution in (i) ACN/water =1/1 v/v was a true micellar solution, in (ii) ACN/water = 2/8 v/v was a biphasic system with a lamellar liquid crystalline phase, and in (iii) ACN/water = 8/2 was a molecular solution. In spite of these extreme differences, after 20 min reaction with TEOS, all compositions presented a well-developed mesoporous structure with similar pore dimensions. In case i, the mechanism of precipitation on preformed micelles is straightforward. In case ii, EPR of spin probes has provided evidence that tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) addition leads to an immediate phase transformation of the liquid crystalline phase to a micellar solution, on which silica precipitation occurs. Compared with i and ii, no DDA aggregates were found in solution before or during precipitation for the third solvent mixture iii, pointing to a true cooperative mechanism. XRD and nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements entirely support these data. Interestingly, the precipitate formed in the first 5 min was nonstructured for all systems, even for i where preformed micelles were present. © 2007 American Chemical Society.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=5, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None),\n",

Here we show that a new family of tuneable mesoporous carbonaceous catalysts derived from starch can be used to accomplish efficient chemistry in aqueous solution. Our new aqueous catalytic chemistry relies on the ability to adjust the surface properties including the hydrophobicity-hydrophilicity balance of mesoporous Starbons by carbonisation at different temperatures (250-750°C).

Three synthesis procedures were compared: (i) direct synthesis by using tetraethyl orthosilicate as the silica source, boric acid as the boron source and the surfactant cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide, (ii) direct synthesis with a post-synthesis treatment in NH4F solution and (iii) capillary impregnation of mesoporous Si-MCM-41. The solid structures were analysed by XRD, N2 adsorption, TG-DTA and DRIFT. The surface acidity was determined by TPD and DRIFT by using pyridine as the probe molecule. Furthermore, the presence of acid and basic sites was shown from the conversion of 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol. This study indicated that samples obtained by direct synthesis had both acid and basic properties, while fluorinated samples had mainly acid properties and those synthesised by capillary impregnation exhibited predominantly basic properties. Likewise, an increase in boron content produced a decrease in both the intensity of the XRD peaks and BET surface area as well as an increase in total acidity. In the absence of deactivation processes (pulse method), at 573 K, silicates and borosilicates MCM-41 catalysed the formation of by-products of ε-caprolactam, although this process was favoured on solids with mainly basic properties. Under continuous flow reaction conditions, at 723 K, results indicated that the incorporation of boron to the Si-MCM-41 framework did not affect the activity and product distribution. Finally, when acetonitrile was used as the solvent in a continuous flow system, although selectivity to ε-caprolactam improved, the by-products of ε-caprolactam adsorption were also favoured resulting in the deterioration of catalyst life. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Often, the homocoupling reactions of substituted acetylenic derivatives are concomitant to the Sonogashira pathway and time-consuming optimization procedures are required in order to reach satisfactory levels of selectivity. In this paper, the potential of a class of Pd-complexes loaded to mesoporous silica gel in promoting the Sonogashira reaction between aryl acetylenes and iodoarenes is underlined. This family of heterogeneous organo-palladium systems allows the desired cross-coupled compounds to be isolated in excellent yield under very mild conditions. In fact, the absence of organic solvents, copper(I) co-catalyst and phosphane ligands, (which are easily oxidisable and whose preparation has a heavy environmental impact), in conjunction with the low catalyst loading ([Pd] 0.1-1 mol%) and its recoverability, stresses the environmental benefits of the protocol. The Sonogashira/homocoupling selectivity proved to be function of the haloarene employed. As a matter of fact, while iodoarenes bearing EWG (electron withdrawing groups) on the phenyl ring underwent smoothly the Sonogashira pathway, electron-rich iodobenzenes showed opposite behaviour by mainly furnishing the homocoupling product. The use of bromoarenes provided solely the homocoupling product in excellent yield without themselves being consumed. This is despite that fact that the catalysts used activate bromoarenes equally as well as iodoarenes in both Heck and Suzuki systems. Kinetic investigations revealed a highly temperature-dependent profile, which indicates strongly that the reaction takes place at the surface. Finally, the full heterogeneous character of the catalytically active species as well as the reusability of the immobilised Pd-complex were confirmed by hot-filtration test and by multiple reuses of the supported catalyst in subsequent Sonogashira cross-couplings. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The particles obtained from this route are cylindrical, with partially aligned mesopores, in contrast to those obtained from aqueous ethanol, which are spherical and have a wormhole structure. A further major advantage is that the amine-functionalised materials, formed by direct co-condensation, are nucleophilic, in contrast to those prepared from aqueous ethanol.

The catalytic activity of Al-MCM-48 materials in isopropylbenzene dealkylation was compared with those of the microporous H-Y and ZSM-5 zeolites and that of a commercial silica-alumina catalyst (Harshaw, Si235, 13 wt% alumina). For these solids, the catalytic activity was related to the tetrahedral or octahedral (probably AlO5F species) aluminum for nonfluorinated and fluorinated catalysts, respectively. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Cyclohexene conversion reaction proceeds mainly according to two different processes: skeletal isomerisation (SI) and hydrogen transfer (HT). Results showed an increase in catalytic activity when increasing the temperature and data were well correlated with total acidity (pyridine titration data). On the other hand, alkylation reactions are widely applied in the industry. In this sense, acidic materials applied to this reaction, using dimethyl carbonate as alkylating agent, were found catalytically active. Results indicate that the first alkylation step leads to ortho-(preferred) and para-positions. Similar conversion values were found for samples and selectivity to xylenes was higher than 80 mol %. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TG/DTA, XRD, and laser-Raman spectroscopy showed that the method assisted by an organic additive resulted in AlPO4 with higher thermal stabilities (crystallization was delayed), as well as high surface areas and pore volumes even after calcination at 1073/1273 K. In all cases, 27Al and 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy only indicated the formation of tetrahedral Al-(OP)4 and P(OAl)4 units. Moreover, surface areas and pore volumes depended on the organic additive used. Thus, the AlPO4 obtained in the presence of 1,3-propanediol and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol possessed higher thermal stabilities that resulted in larger surface areas and pore volumes. Surface acidity measurements, through chemisorption (measured by gaschromatography) of pyridine and 2,6-dimethylpyridine at 473-573 K, indicated that the AlPO4 obtained in the presence of 1,3-propanediol and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol exhibited surface acid sites even after calcination at 1273 K.
