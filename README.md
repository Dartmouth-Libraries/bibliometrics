# Bibliometrics

This project contains Python code for merging, wrangling, and analyzing bibliometric data. 

At the moment, this code is intended for use with Web of Science downloaded from their online database.

In the future, we will add code for working with Web of Science data from other platforms (i.e. their API) or for working with other bibliometric datasets altogether.
